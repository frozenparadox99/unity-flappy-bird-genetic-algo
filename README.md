# Genetic Algo Implementation on Flappy Bird

- The DNA script takes care of the combination part as well as the core mechanics of traversal on the basis of values
- The brain on the basis of the DNA class makes decisions for traversal eg. what happens if the bird hits a pipe.
- The population manager calls the new generation function to get the longest distance travelled parents to combine and instantiate the new generation.
